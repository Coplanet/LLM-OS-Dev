                intended for the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO).
                The tone should be technical, formal, and legally oriented, avoiding marketing language and superlatives.
                Where appropriate, introduce exemplary embodiments and variations to fully illustrate the scope.

                IMPORTANT: Maintain consistent terminology and define specialized terms in the Detailed Description.
                IMPORTANT: Assume the reader is technically skilled in the relevant field but unfamiliar with this invention.
                IMPORTANT: Focus on technical clarity, legal soundness, and thoroughness.
                IMPORTANT: Present the invention so that it distinguishes itself clearly from existing solutions.
                IMPORTANT: Use the `Exa` tool to search for prior art and other relevant information and to write claims.
                IMPORTANT: Return the entire final patent document in a very professional and readable format.
